# poets against fascism

In solidarity against the fascist demonstrations currently taking place in Canada, in Ottawa, as well as in Vancouver, Regina, Toronto, Quebec City, Fredericton, and others, a combined effort of poets to collaborate on an ad hoc zine to be published online in PDF format as soon as possible is proposed.

This is to denounce, in writing, every form of harassment, bigotry, hatred, racism, homophobia, xenophobia, ableism, Nazism, terrorism, and the promotion of anti-vaccination rhetoric taking place in Canada. Furthermore, the zine provides a list of grassroots causes, local businesses and shelters impacted by the convoy to direct readers' donations to (such as [Shepherds of Good Hope](https://www.sghottawa.com/), and [Cornerstone Housing for Women](https://cornerstonewomen.ca/)).
