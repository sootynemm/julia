# Repos

**Jupyter Notebook and GDP Datasets**
Initial commit: October 4, 2023
[jupyter-world-gdp](https://github.com/sootynemm/jupyter-world-gdp)
This is a work-in-progress interactive Jupyter Notebook demonstrating visualizations of global GDP over time, pulled in from a recent Kaggle dataset: [World GDP by Country, Region, and Income Group](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/world-gdp-by-country-region-and-income-group), 1960-2022.

***spacies*** **, a Space Invaders clone in Rust and Python**
Initial commit: ctober 4, 2023
[spacies](https://github.com/sootynemm/spacies)
As part of the culminating project for [Nathan Stocks' Ultimate Rust certification course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-crash-course/), I programmed a Space Invaders clone in Rust that runs in the terminal, and I coded all the music and sfx using Python's [SciPy](https://pypi.org/project/scipy/) and [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) libraries, concatenating sine wave functions at various frequencies and durations to set the atmosphere.

**Simple Harmonic Motion Problems in Julia using DifferentialEquations.jl and Pluto**
Initial commit: November 22, 2022
[harmonic.jl](https://github.com/sootynemm/harmonic.jl)
A code-along from [doggo dot jl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LlW_fpcllA) in Julia, using Pluto Notebook, to demonstrate interactive simulations of Newtonian physics with dials, sliders, and tinkerability.

**Write The Docs French Machine Translation**
Initial commit: November 20, 2022
[writethedocs_guide_fr](https://github.com/sootynemm/writethedocs_guide_fr/tree/da87143ebcb00c8c9e04ee86c8422dda01739a32/docs/guide)
An open-source French translation for [the Write The Docs community guide](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/). This translated guide has yet to be implemented, having led to a community block regarding the implementation of a localization CI/CD pipeline for the website, without which, updating the documentation across languages would become an act of juggling cats, sadly.
